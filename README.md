# iv-calculator

This is a simple, text-based IV calculator for Pokemon, written in C.

It is designed for generations 3-7.

## How to use:
- Download and unzip iv.zip
- Run the run.bat file
- Enter the respective information of the pokemon you wish to calculate its IVs for
- Enter the stats and EVs through a dash in order: HP-ATTACK-DEFENSE-SP.ATTACK-SP.DEFENSE-SPEED (e.g. 85-60-50-42-36-51)
- If you wish to set all EVs to 0, simply enter a single 0, this works for any other number
- If you wish to calculate IVs for another pokemon in the same command block, simply enter "iv"

## Note:
- This program is not case-sensitive (e.g. "calm" is the same as "CALM" or "CaLM")
- Raw EVs should be entered (0-255), not the EVs divided by 4
- Keep the iv.exe, data and run.bat files in the same folder
