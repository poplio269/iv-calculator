# iv-calculator

This is a simple, text-based IV calculator for Pokemon.
It is designed for generation 3 and above
It is designed for Windows

How to use:
Run the run.bat file
Enter the name, level, stats, EVs and nature of the pokemon you wish to calculate its IVs for
Enter the stats and EVs through a dash in order: HP-ATTACK-DEFENSE-SP.ATTACK-SP.DEFENSE-SPEED (e.g. 85-60-50-42-36-51)
If you wish to set all EVs to 0, simply enter a single 0, this works for any other number
If you wish to calculate IVs for another pokemon in the same command block, simply enter "iv"

Note:
This program is not case-sensitive (e.g. "calm" is the same as "CALM" or "CaLM")
Enter the raw EVs (0-255), not the EVs divided by 4
Keep the iv.exe, data and run.bat files in the same folder (iv.c is the source code, it is not needed)
